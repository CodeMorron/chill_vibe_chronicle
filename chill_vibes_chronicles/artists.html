      <h2>Who is WYS</h2>
      <p>
        WYS is a multi-instrumentalist based in the East of France. He has been
        playing music since he was a child. He started with playing the drums to
        then discover other instruments. He grew up listening to mostly indie rock
        bands (such as Ween, Sparklehorse or Grandaddy), which have been his
        greatest source of inspiration up to this day. However, he has always been
        curious about discovering and experimenting new genres. He worked as a
        composer and sound-designer for music in advertising and short movies
        before he became passionate about lofi hip-hop. Most of his tracks evoke a
        bittersweet feeling of nostalgia.
